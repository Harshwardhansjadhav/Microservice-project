# Building a Scalable and Resilient Microservices Architecture with AWS EKS, GitOps, ArgoCD, and Istio
## **Implemented a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS EKS with GitOps and Istio for Modern Microservices**

I designed and deployed a Kubernetes cluster using AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), adhering to GitOps principles with ArgoCD to achieve automated and seamless continuous deployment workflows. To optimize traffic management, observability, and security, I integrated Istio as a service mesh.

This project highlights a robust microservices-based architecture powering a dynamic website, composed of multiple services developed in Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js. The stack demonstrates scalability, fault tolerance, and streamlined deployments, aligning with modern DevOps practices.
